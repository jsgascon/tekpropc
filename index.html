      <h1>Services</h1>
      <h2>Computer Repair</h2>
      <p>
        Computer Repair includes a multitude of disciplines. They include: hardware diagnostics, hardware replacement, virus removals, operating system installs, software troubleshooting, and much more. <br>
        At TekPro PC we're well versed in all PC hardware, including laptops. We're very capable and pride ourselves in providing the service you need. Many of our business clients even refer us to their parents because we'll explain things in an easy to understand manor and take the computer fear away. <br>
      </p>
      <h2>Laptop Repair</h2>
      <p>
        Laptops are compact and convenient. A lot of companies out there charge big bucks for fixing laptops; we're still just charging our flat rate labor charge of $99 plus parts if needed. <br>
        When it comes to laptop repair, you want to make sure you're working with somebody that has experience. There are about 50 screws to take apart a laptop, and we know where they came from and how they go back. <br>
      </p>
      <h2>Computer Viruses</h2>
      <p>
        Computer Viruses can do great harm to your computer and amount for approximately 70% of the computer issues we get in our shop. We can perform virus removals 2 different ways. <br>
        The preferred option is to do a Wipe &amp; Reload with a data backup. With this option we take all the files on your computer and place them in a backup folder. Then we reinstall your Windows operating system. With this option you will need to reinstall any software you have. We're happy to assist you with this if you need us to. The best benefit of this approach is it guarantees that the viruses you had are not in your operating system. <br>
        The second approach we can attempt is to perform virus scans with a different computer. It is essential to perform the scan on a different operating system to allow the viruses to be removed. This approach is about 95% effective because not all viruses are known. We still guarantee our work for 30 days. <br>
      </p>
      <h2>DC Jack Repair</h2>
      <p>
        It seems to be the case that the laptops we all use are not as portable as we would like. They almost always have a cord attached. The DC Jack is very susceptible to breaking due to the laptop being dropped on the cord or pulling on the cord. <br>
        At TekPro PC we are experienced in DC Jack Replacement. If you already have a loose connection, please do not wait to bring it in. This situation can often rip out the soldier eyes from the motherboard of you laptop and make your notebook a brick. This service is only $100 and it includes the DC Jack. <br>
      <h2>Data Recovery</h2>
      <p>
        If you have a desktop or laptop that you just need the data off of, we can recover it for you and transfer it to another computer or external hard drive. <br>
      We're even able, in most instances, to recover your data off of failing hard drives, corrupted file systems, formatted hard drives, or deleted files. <br>
      </p>
      <h2>Memory Upgrades</h2>
      <p>
        Increasing your computer memory is an easy way to speed up your computer with minimal cost. Systems today should have at least 1GB for Windows XP and 2 GB for Windows Vista and Windows 7. Call us to discuss the best options for you. <br>
